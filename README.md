# Simple chat
This was a test task, so the implementation is primitive.

Done in July 2017. Maybe I can do better now, but I don't want to make edits, so I publish it as it is.

The task was:
Implement a public chat client using any framework (Qt is suitable) and a minimalistic chat server in C++. Both architectural solutions and appearance will be evaluated. There are no restrictions on using third-party libraries for working with the network.
